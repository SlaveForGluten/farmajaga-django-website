I wanted to have a fully functional website online and learn what's there to learn about creating and deploying one.
For this project I used:
- Django
- html
- bootstrap
- CSS
- Crispy forms
- AWS S3 service
- Google Maps API
- Heroku as a host and SSL provider
- Namecheap to get a custom domain name
